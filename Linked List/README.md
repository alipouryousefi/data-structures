A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains two parts: the data (or value) and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node's reference typically points to null, indicating the end of the list.

In JavaScript, linked lists are commonly implemented using objects or classes to represent nodes and manage the list.

Explanation:

1. We define a Node class to represent individual nodes in the linked list. Each node has two properties: data to store the value and next to store the reference to the next node.

2.We define the LinkedList class to manage the list. It has a property head that points to the first node in the list.

3. The append method is used to add a new node with the given data to the end of the linked list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head. Otherwise, we traverse the list to find the last node and attach the new node to it.

4. The print method traverses the linked list and prints the elements in the order they appear.

This is a basic implementation of a singly linked list in JavaScript.
