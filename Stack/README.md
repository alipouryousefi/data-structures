you can implement a stack using an array. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

In the example, we create a Stack class with methods to perform common stack operations:

1. push(element): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. pop(): Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
3. peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
5. size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.
6. clear(): Clears the stack by removing all elements.
We can then create a new Stack object and perform various stack operations, such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements, checking the top element, checking if the stack is empty, and clearing the stack.

Stacks are commonly used in solving problems involving recursion, parsing expressions, maintaining function calls, and more.
