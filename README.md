Data Structures in JavaScript

This repository contains examples and implementations of various data structures using JavaScript. Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that help organize and store data efficiently. Understanding and using data structures is crucial for writing optimized algorithms and building efficient applications.


Introduction<br/>
In this repository, you'll find JavaScript implementations of the following data structures:

Arrays<br/>
Linked Lists<br/>
Stacks<br/>
Queues<br/>
Trees<br/>
Binary Search Trees (BST)<br/>
Graphs<br/>
Hash Tables (Hash Maps)<br/>
Heaps<br/>
Tries<br/>
Sets<br/>
Queues with Priority<br/>
Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)<br/>
Bloom Filters<br/>
Skip Lists<br/>

Each data structure comes with detailed explanations, code examples, and usage scenarios to help you understand their functionalities and use cases.

How to Use This Repository<br/>
You can clone this repository using the following command:<br/>

bash<br/>
Copy code<br/>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-javascript.git<br/>
After cloning the repository, navigate to the respective data structure folder to explore the code examples and explanations.

Data Structures Covered<br/>
Arrays<br/>
Arrays are collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, accessible using an index.

Linked Lists<br/>
Linked Lists are collections of elements (nodes) where each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Stacks<br/>
Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

...

Examples<br/>
Each data structure folder contains a README.md file that provides an overview of the data structure, its functionalities, and its implementation in JavaScript. The examples folder within each data structure folder contains JavaScript code examples showcasing various operations on the data structure.
