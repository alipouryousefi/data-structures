# Tries

Tries, also known as prefix trees or radix trees, are tree-like data structures used for efficient retrieval of strings or sequences. They are particularly useful for searching for words, prefixes, or patterns in a large dataset.

In a Trie, each node represents a single character of the string, and the path from the root node to a particular node forms the string represented by that node. The edges of the Trie are labeled with characters, and each node can have multiple children, one for each possible character in the dataset.

In the example, we have two classes: TrieNode representing each node of the Trie and Trie representing the Trie itself. The insert method is used to insert a word into the Trie, the search method checks if a complete word exists in the Trie, and the startsWith method checks if a prefix exists in the Trie.

Tries are widely used in various applications like autocomplete, spell checkers, and IP routing tables, where fast string matching and retrieval are required.
