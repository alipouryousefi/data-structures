# Graphs

Graphs are a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They are used to represent relationships between different entities. There are various types of graphs, such as directed graphs, undirected graphs, weighted graphs, etc. 

In the example, we created a simple undirected graph with three nodes (1, 2, and 3) and added edges between them. The adjacencyList will now look like this:

This implementation provides a basic understanding of how to represent and create graphs in JavaScript using an adjacency list. You can extend this implementation to support other types of graphs and add various graph algorithms to perform operations like traversal, finding paths, and more.
