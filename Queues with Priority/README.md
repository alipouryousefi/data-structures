# Queues with Priority

In JavaScript, you can implement a Priority Queue using an array with objects to store elements and their priorities. Each element in the queue will have a value and a priority. The priority determines the order in which elements are dequeued, with higher priority elements dequeued before lower priority elements.

In the example, we created a Priority Queue and added three tasks with different priorities. When dequeuing, the tasks are dequeued in order of their priority (higher priority first). The isEmpty() method is used to check if the priority queue is empty.
