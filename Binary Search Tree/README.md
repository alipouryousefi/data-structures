A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree where each node has at most two children, and the left child node contains a value less than or equal to the parent node, while the right child node contains a value greater than the parent node. This property makes BSTs useful for searching, insertion, and deletion operations in a sorted manner.

In the example, we create a Node class to represent a node in the BST. Each node has a value, left child node, and right child node. We also create the BinarySearchTree class, which has methods for insertion, search, and in-order traversal.

The insert method is used to insert a new value into the BST while maintaining the BST property. The search method is used to find a specific value in the BST, and the inOrderTraversal method performs an in-order traversal of the BST, which visits nodes in ascending order.

With this basic implementation, you can perform operations like inserting values into the BST, searching for values, and traversing the BST in a sorted order. BSTs are commonly used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of values in sorted data.
