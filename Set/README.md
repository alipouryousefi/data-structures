# Sets

In JavaScript, a Set is a built-in data structure that represents a collection of unique values. It allows you to store distinct elements and provides methods for managing and manipulating those elements.

Sets in JavaScript are useful when you need to store unique values and perform operations like checking for existence, adding/removing elements efficiently. They provide constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and searching operations, making them a handy data structure for managing collections with unique elements.
