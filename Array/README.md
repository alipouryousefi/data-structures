# Array

In JavaScript, an array is a fundamental data structure used to store and manage a collection of elements. It allows you to group multiple values of any data type into a single variable. Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove elements, and they can hold elements of different types.

Arrays are versatile and widely used in JavaScript for various purposes, such as storing data, iterating through elements, and implementing algorithms. Understanding how to work with arrays is essential for effective JavaScript programming.
